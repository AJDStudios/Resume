                <p class="portnote"> Note * As these games will be commercial projects - the source code is not available *</p>
                <p>Made with the RPG maker engine and Java plugins (for example the "breathing enemies). OST (mostly), original artwork (ongoing)"</p> 
                <p>The original game has 25-40 hours of gameplay available. Now I'm working on replacing engine features with my own and making the game bigger.</p> 
                <p>The original is fully functional, if less pretty. There is a more up-to-date and full-version gameplay <a href="https://youtu.be/vPeS85kVHEk" target="_blank"> <span>video</span></a> but it takes longer to get into the game and there is an active chat.</p>
                <a href="https://discord.gg/tMMVKstvac" target="_blank"><span>Both the original game and the current version of the new game can be downloaded for free directly via the linked discord</span></a>

                <p>made with Ren-py (Python)</p>
                <p>The majority of the other project displays here are part of the design phase of this particular game - OST, sounds, art, story.</p>
                <p>features to present are limited beyond the GUI for now</p>
