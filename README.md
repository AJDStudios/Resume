# Resume
A modern CV for frontend software engineer

Now on the seventh iteration of a resume - built a basic HTML and CSS website akin to something I would have made 15 years ago when i did this kind of thing. 

Core features 
          - responsive and built with a "mobile-first" mindset. 
          - built using multiple languages (some of which will be experimental)
    

Designing this block by block
 - first block was the nav bar (without links) made with Html, CSS and Javascript for the "hamburger"
 - second block was actually the top block - animated splash with my name and job aspired to.
            TODO:
                - still need to animate the texts as layers. Probably using javascript. So one writes, fades out, and then is replaced by the other one. Repeat this.
                - after 5 or 6 repeats - add an easter egg. 
 -Third block was the about section. This is now laid out an has a draft of content.
 - added a dark/light mode toggle (that doesn't actually change the colours yet.) using javascript.
 - added the relevant needed templates (navbar still doesn't link right now but "/" works)  
 - animated the portfolio head
 - laid the groundwork for a couple easter eggs - only found if you check the code or try fairly basic functionality. 
 - imported some portfolio pieces as statics
 - added the footer (still needs some work and the translation button)
 - navbar is now functional  
 - added stage 1 of Easter egg 2 

        Next steps
            - make the navbar sticky? in general it's good, but not sure any page is going to be big enough for it to have meaning - may do it just to make sure I can. 
            - dark and light toggle needs to actually change the colour scheme - probably invert it... but need to decide on light theme still.

        Broader TODO
            - portfolio template
            - contact form and template
            - skills template
            - animate the other headers x4
            - Add Russian
