# Resume
A modern CV for frontend software engineer

Now on the seventh iteration of a resume - built a basic HTML and CSS website akin to something I would have made 15 years ago when i did this kind of thing. 

Core features 
          - responsive and built with a "mobile-first" mindset. 
          - built using multiple languages (some of which will be experimental)

Designing this block by block
 - first block was the nav bar (without links) made with Html, CSS and Javascript for the "hamburger"
 - second block was actually the top block - animated splash with my name and job aspired to.
            TODO:
                - still need to animate the texts as layers. Probably using javascript. So one writes, fades out, and then is replaced by the other one. Repeat this.
                - after 5 or 6 repeats - add an easter egg. 
 -Third block was the about section. This is now laid out.
            TODO
                - run jinja on it so it also animates.
 - added a dark/light mode toggle (that doesn't actually change the colours yet.) using javascript.
